Quanta Core
=============

Setup
---------------------
Quanta Core is the original Quanta client and it builds the backbone of the network. It downloads and, by default, stores the entire history of Quanta transactions, which requires several hundred gigabytes or more of disk space. Depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization process can take anywhere from a few hours to several days or more.

To download Quanta Core, visit [quantanetwork.org](https://quantanetwork.org/#downloads).

Running
---------------------
The following are some helpful notes on how to run Quanta Core on your native platform.

### Unix

Unpack the files into a directory and run:

- `bin/quanta-qt` (GUI) or
- `bin/quantad` (headless)
- `bin/quanta` (wrapper command)

The `quanta` command supports subcommands like `quanta gui`, `quanta node`, and `quanta rpc` exposing different functionality. Subcommands can be listed with `quanta help`.

### Windows

Unpack the files into a directory, and then run quanta-qt.exe.

### macOS

Drag Quanta Core to your applications folder, and then run Quanta Core.
